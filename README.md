<h2>:books: Project Description</h2>
<p>The aim of this app is to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. In addition, the appn offers a tasks list, with information regarding their start date, duration and status.</p>

<p>In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with many of ReactJS features, using styled-components, contexts, reducers, immers, routing with React Router DOM, ReactHook Form and hookform/resolvers, using zod for validation. Also, I was able to work with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.</p>
