## üìö Project Description
Focus-to-Do is a Pomodoro Timer. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps improve productivity and focus. This application implements the Ignite Timer, allowing you to break your work into intervals of focused work and short breaks.

The aim of this app is to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. In addition, the app offers a tasks list, with information regarding their start date, duration and status.

The application includes the following features: 

- **Customizable Timer**: Set the duration for work sessions (typically known as "pomodoros") and breaks according to your preference.
- **Visual Alerts:** Receive visual cues when a work session or break ends, ensuring you stay on track and transition smoothly.
- **Session History:** Track and review your completed pomodoros and breaks to monitor your progress and productivity.

## üìå What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with many of ReactJS features, using styled-components, contexts, reducers, immers, routing with React Router DOM, ReactHook Form and hookform/resolvers, using zod for validation. Also, I was able to work with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.
